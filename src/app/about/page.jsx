          <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            Founded with the goal to simplify online buying and selling, our platform bridges
            the gap between traditional local trade and modern e-commerce.  
            We started as a small community initiative and have grown into a platform that
            values trust, transparency, and the power of direct communication.
