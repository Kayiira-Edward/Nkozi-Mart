          <>
            Our marketplace is currently <strong>free and open to everyone</strong>â€”no account needed to browse or buy.  
            Buyers add products to their cart and place orders <strong>directly via WhatsApp</strong>, where they communicate and negotiate with sellers for a trustworthy experience.
            <br /><br />
            Sellers can register by clicking the <Link href="/auth?mode=register" className="text-[#2edc86] hover:underline">Become a Seller</Link> button, create their store, upload products, and manage them from a personalized dashboard.

            Currently, order tracking is not available on the platform. All communication and negotiation happen directly between buyer and seller via WhatsApp to ensure transparency and trust.

            Shipping, delivery, and payment terms are <strong>directly negotiated between the buyer and seller on WhatsApp</strong>.  
            We recommend opting for <strong>payment on delivery</strong> to reduce risks and build trust.  
            Always confirm all details with the seller before completing any payment.
